## Project Zohali (Saturn)
This is an API that consumes Kenya Power's Tweets to check for scheduled/planned maintenance in Kenya.
Information extracted includes the Region, County, Area, Specific places, time as well as date of the planned incidents.

Future developments include intergrating with a Tweeter Bot service that tweets the extracted information to the tweeter audience.
